# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

However, considering this is just me testing Ruby on Rails and getting a feel for coding with it, I'm kinda just inclined to goof around with it and leave this blank. Only time will tell if this app will one day say hello to everyone in the world. I will wait.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
